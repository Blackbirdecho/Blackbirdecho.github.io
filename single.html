                                  <p>Well, this month’s PS Plus games have not been a let down since we have got two good titles and an interactive movie kinda game. For those of you who didn't know, we got NBA 2K20, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and ERICA.

                                      Since I have played all these games I’m gonna tell what I enjoyed the most.</p>

 

                                  <h2>  <b>PS Plus July 2020</b></h2>

<p>First up is NBA 2K20 which in my opinion is exactly like NBA 2K19. I didn't see any graphical improvements and the Career mode also seems to be the same. I would only play this game for the multiplayer aspect. So if you like basketball go for this one.</p>

<p>Second is the Rise of the Tomb Raider which I liked very much. This was my first Tomb Raider game and overall it was great. The storyline will keep you engaged and the gameplay is pretty smooth. When you download this game, you also get two expansion titles that can be played. The game’s playtime is almost under 14 hours. It also has co-op mode and a multiplayer mode. I would suggest you play this.</p>

<p>The third one is called ERICA, it’s an interactive movie you can say and I haven't completed it. So far it has not been boring. So if you’d like to try this, go for it.</p>





                                  <h2><b>Games to buy in July:</b></h2>

<p>For this month’s deals in India, we have some exciting discounts. The sections are as follows:</p>
<ul>

                                      <h2><b>July Savings:</b></h2>

                                  <p>So this section of Deals and offers have a variety of games that are worthwhile.</p>

                                      <p>Spider-Man which is a ps4 exclusive is according to people a great game. It was very well received and right now it costs <b>Rs. 1250</b> Which is great in my opinion. I’m looking forward to downloading this since it is a steal.</p>
<p>God of War is here everybody. Since I already played and downloaded like most people I know that this game is awesome. For those of you who didn't play this, please do, like right now.</p>
                                      <p>No Man’s Sky didn't stand our much when it came out but it is having great reviews now, it is <b>Rs. 1250</b>. For people who like exploring and killing aliens, I would suggest you download this.</p>
                                      <p>Assassins Creed Odyssey is very much a recent game. It has a great storyline and good graphics. Fans of the Assassins creed Franchise love it and even others too. You can download it for <b>Rs. 1499</b>.</p>
                                      <p>Resident Evil 7 is a horror game that has nice graphics and an FPS gameplay which will scare you. If you can play it, it'll be worthwhile. You can download it for <b>Rs. 749</b>.</p>
                                      <p>Ghost Recon Breakpoint is a third-person shooter and although I don't know much about this game, I would download it as I love shooting games. You can download it for <b>Rs. 1099</b>.</p>
<p>There were other games on the PS Store you can check them out I didn't go on about them as I think these are the best ones.</p> 



                                      <h2><b>Deal of the Week:</b></h2>

                                      <p>Need for Speed Rivals is on this which costs <b>Rs. 299</b>. If racing is for you, download it. It’s very cheap anyway.</p>



                                  <h2><b>Multiplayer Days</b></h2>

                                      <p>The only games I liked in this section are Battlefield 5 and The Forest. You really can't go wrong when buying a battlefield game, it costs  <b>Rs. 1049</b>. And the other game, which is The Forest, a survival game which also supports coop gameplay costs <b>Rs. 707</b>.</p>



                                  <h2><b>Games under Rs. 1250</b></h2>

                                      <p>The only one I think is the most appealing is Assassins creed Unity which costs <b>Rs. 494</b>. Assassins creed games have great storylines and gameplay, even though the gameplay doesn't seem to be challenging it is pretty good.</p>



                                  <h2><b>Price Drops</b></h2>

                                  <p>They are the same ones in July savings Section.</p>
