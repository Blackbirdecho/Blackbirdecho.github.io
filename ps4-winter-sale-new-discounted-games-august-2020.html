                                    <p>More games have been added in the Summer/Winter sale section of the Deals and Offer section in the ps4 store.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m going to give a list of games which I think you should buy among these newly added games.</p>

<h2>Call of Duty Modern Warfare:</h2>
<p>This game is now on the Ps4 store for <strong>Rs: 2599. </strong>Considering that this game came out like a year ago and till now it stayed on the price tag of Rs: 3999, this reduction is pretty good. The player base for this game is on the top. Most of the people don&rsquo;t like warzone because of crossplay, as the PC players have an advantage over the console players in terms of aim, movement, and weapons shifting. The campaign is really cool. There are iconic missions and great gameplay. Then there is multiplayer, you cannot get fed up with this. The ranking system is great, the customization is dope, I mean, there aren&apos;t many complaints about this one. Go for it!</p>
<p><br /></p>
 <img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/doom-eternal-4.jpg?w=1200&strip=all" alt="DOOM Eternal" class="responsive"/>                                 
<h2>DOOM Eternal:</h2>
<p>People think that the DOOM series has no good storyline and so It&apos;s not a good game. Those people are LOSERS!!. You don&rsquo;t need a storyline, you need kickass gameplay and the DOOM series provides it in ample amount. The game mechanics are of a different level. In addition to a lot of guns, you also get, a Flamethrower and a Knife, and a Fricking Sword!. As If the game wasn&rsquo;t already badass. This game is discounted and on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 1999</strong>. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with this one. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CbfbrXTqArU/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="Overwatch Legendary Edition" class="responsive"/>                   
<h2>Overwatch Legendary Edition:</h2>
<p>This game come out in 2016 and apparently is a fan favorite. If you have played Paladins, then this game is similar to this one but a lot better. It gives out a cartoonish vibe. If you have friends who play this game then its a lot better. It isn&apos;t free to play and it isn&apos;t crossplay. The discounted price on the ps store is <strong>Rs: 1154</strong>. There are also talks going on about Overwatch 2 so I think it&apos;s a good time to play this game.</p>
<p><br /></p>
 <img src="https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/rocket-arena.jpg" alt="Rocket Arena" class="responsive"/>                                 
<h2>Rocket Arena:</h2>
<p>As I have talked about in the Overwatch section, this game is pretty similar, just one thing is different, there are no guns, but rockets. There are many characters to choose from and many different rockets, rocket customizations to work with, and also to show off. It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 339</strong>. This game came out this year and It&apos;s cheap. Its a steal!!. But you must like this kind of gameplay to buy it. All in all, it is a great thing to have.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Elder Scrolls Online:</h2>
<p>It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 799</strong>. I do believe that many people will like this, but it&apos;s not for me. Its an MMORPG game in which you will need to grind in order to level up like crazy and participate in events. This game goes on for like infinity, There are a lot of things to do. In order to kill monsters, you&apos;ll have to increase your attack and armour and also your other things like braces and heels etc. So party up! and start grinding. </p>
<p><br /></p>
  <img src="https://www.tapestry.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/COD-black-ops-artwork-inlay.jpg" alt="COD Black Ops 4" class="responsive"/>                                  
<h2>Call of Duty Black Ops 4:</h2>
<p>This game came out in 2018. Right now, it is on the ps4 for the price of <strong>Rs: 1319</strong>. It is the 4th game in the Black Ops franchise. It is an FPS game with single-player gameplay and also multiplayer. There is also a new mode which was introduced in the franchise, Blackout. Basically it is a battle royale mode. The graphics are not up to par with the modern warfare game but it is crazy fast. There is also other stuff like robotic arms, legs and jetpacks etc. All these things are unrealistic but, a lot of fun. There is also an option for party and clan creation. I wouldn&apos;t have bought it if not for the new modern warfare. But if the price is an issue, go for this one.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Uncharted the Lost Legacy:</h2>
<p>I&apos;m downloading this game as of now. It is on the ps store for the price of <strong>Rs: 674</strong>. The 5th game in the uncharted series. But there is a catch, you don&apos;t get to play as Nathan Drake but Chloe Frazer. The woman with the hot accent. But it shouldn&apos;t be an issue as she is equally agile and smart as Drake. The gameplay is like a movie and the story is what makes the game. You get to play as a treasure hunter on the move and fighting bad guys, and you also have your friends to help you out, like Samuel Drake. I suggest you play this game at least once in a lifetime.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Anthem:</h2>
<p>It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 675</strong>. It is a third person shooter  game. A lot of people have complained about the game being not smooth and the graphics shown on the E3 conference was not the same in the gameplay. There have been reports of many bugs in the game and the loading time also appears to be slow. The game&apos;s map is large and the enemies are unique. You can also party up and slave these aliens or monsters. There is also an option for a clan creation and talks are going on with the multiplayer aspect of the game. </p>
<p>All in all, the games are very good. So if you planning to spend on games this month on the ps store, these should be the obvious choice. But you must hurry a little as these discounted prices last only till 20th August. So stay safe, and play hard!.</p>
