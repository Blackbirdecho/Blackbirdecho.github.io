                                  <p>&emsp;Playstation has been generous this time around as even before we have got to know about the next august 2020 free games we have a sale going on, known as the Winter sale in the Indian Ps store. This along with the price drops is the only section in the deals and offers menu. This section contains many games at discounted prices. So I&rsquo;ll give you a list of games I think are cheap and the best ones available on the ps store. Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>

<h2>FIFA 2020:&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Football lovers love this game. Although I didn&apos;t seem to find any major improvements from the 2019 version, it is pretty cool. The graphics are a little bit enhanced and the gameplay is a bit smooth. More character creation tools are added and other than that I don&apos;t know any minor changes. You can buy this game for <strong>Rs: 839 </strong>which in my case is a lot cheaper considering it released only the last year. I would recommend buying this.</p>
<p><br /></p>

                                  <p><br /></p>
<h2>Red Dead Redemption 2:</h2>
<p>Rockstar has done a great job with this game yet again. The storytelling and the gameplay are far better than any other game I have played. The graphics are awesome, along it seems that my ps4 makes a lot of sounds when I play this and gets heated up pretty quick. I seem to enjoy playing this. There is a lot to do in this game, you can complete the main missions, side missions, do activities like poker, etc or join red dead online to play with friends. Along I did find the online mode repetitive, the story mode makes up for this. I think we can all agree that online mode needs much improvement. This is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 1679</strong>.</p>

                                  <p><br /></p>
<h2>Rainbow Six Seige:</h2>
<p>If you like FPS games then this game is for you. The gameplay is all online, meaning that there is no story mode. You can only play with other players all around the world or with friends. The maps are smaller than regular FPS games. The most popular game mode is the bomb mode, where one team protects the bomb, and the other tries to defuse it. There are a lot of operators you can play with who have different unique abilities. It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 599.</strong> Keep in mind that you need to have a ps plus subscription to play this game with players. </p>

<h2>Days Gone:</h2>
<p>This is a zombie apocalyptic game, set in the aftermath of the infection. There is no online mode for this one. The story mode is quite good. And there are a lot of things to do like killing hordes of zombies, main and side missions, clearing areas, etc. The game is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 1159</strong>.</p>
<p><br /></p>
      <img src="https://monstervine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/control-banner.jpg" class="responsive"/>   <p><br /></p>                         
<h2>Control:</h2>
<p>This game is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 1224</strong>. It received good reviews on many websites. I personally haven&apos;t played this game. But I have seen the gameplay and the graphics are great. There is only the story mode here and gameplay also was looking quite fluid. Apparently the lead character has some power to control time.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>Horizon Zero Dawn:</h2>
<p>On the PlayStation store for <strong>Rs: 974</strong>, Horizon zero dawn has received quite the reviews and many people have also loved playing the game. The gameplay is kind of like Warframe in my opinion. It has only the single-player story mode. This game was a delight to play. I recommend you play this as the next part for this game is set to release sometime in 2021.</p>
<p><br /></p>
          <img src="https://images.firstpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/war-zone.jpg" class="responsive"/>    <p><br /></p>                    
<h2>World War Z:</h2>
<p>This game is similar to left 4 dead as it follows mostly the same concept. The only playable mode is the online mode. You play with other players all around the world or with your friends and together you kill the zombies. This game is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 799</strong>. If you looking for a fun game then this might be it. Its a lot more fun to play with friends.</p>

<h2>PlayersUnknown Battlegrounds(PUBG):</h2>
<p>A widely popular game that needs no mention. It started on the mobile platform then moved up its way to PC, to PS4, and Xbox. Currently on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 659</strong>. The playable modes are battle royale, zombie, solo. Its very fun to play with friends, make and join clans and do clans battles. There is the option of competitive gaming too if you wanna make some money. So, overall it is a great game to have in my opinion.</p>
<p><br /></p>

<h2>WWE 2K20:</h2>
<p>This game is the best!!. If you have friends over for dinner then this game is the icebreaker. You can select characters of your own, Male or Female. With your characters comes their own unique finishing moves, attacks, and defense. There are a lot of characters to play with and lots of game modes. It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 979</strong>. Awesome game.</p>
<p><br /></p>
         <img src="https://theempire.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Metro-Exodus-Title.png" class="responsive"/>    <p><br /></p>                     
<h2>Metro Exodus:</h2>
<p>I personally like this game apart from most people. This game contains only the story mode and the main aim of this game is clearing the way for people by killing the animals affected by radioactivity and saving ourselves. The game is on the ps store for Rs: 874. I suggest you download and play it for the experience. It&rsquo;s one of a kind.</p>
<p><br /></p>
         <img src="https://wallpapercave.com/wp/wp2356330.png" class="responsive"/>   <p><br /></p>                      
<h2>Monster Hunter World:</h2>
<p>This is an RPG game set in a fantasy land of humans and monsters. Basically you have to keep killing and salvaging monsters to level up and fight bigger and better monsters. You can play solo or with a party of players and friends. The only thing I don&apos;t like about RPG games is you do have to grind for many hours to level up and reach a better level. It is on the ps store for <strong>Rs: 1,099. </strong>If you have friends playing this game then I suggest you buy it and play, if you play solo, you might get bored easily.</p>
<p><br /></p>
         <img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CEo6zS88H-s/maxresdefault.jpg" class="responsive"/>   <p><br /></p>                      
<h2>Firewall Zero Hour:</h2>
<p>This is a VR game. To play this you need to have a ps VR headset, ps camera, and ideally two motion controllers or an aim controller. It is an FPS VR game that can only be played online with real people. It is only a multiplayer game. Kind of like Rainbow six siege but without operators and special abilities. The main objective of this game is to eliminate the other team before they eliminate you. Honestly, if you have PSVR then you have to buy the game for the experience. It is available on the ps store for Rs: 759. If I were you, I would buy this game right now!.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Keep in mind that all these discounts and offers are valid till August 6th, 2020, after that they will have the regular price tag. Hope you liked the selection of the best deals I think of and feel free to check out other games also on the ps store.  </p>
